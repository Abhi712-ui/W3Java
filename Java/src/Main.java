     * Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class
     * A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
     * Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
     * The name of the java file must match the class name. 
     * When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
